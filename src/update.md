Once selected, a Unity pop-up will warn you about the upcoming import. It is perfectly normal as **RPG Power Forge** is rightfully considered a "complete project" by Unity. Select **[Import]**.

Unity is now listing the files that will be imported in the process. Since you are updating **RPG Power Forge** version, not all of the files have changed, so it's normal if some are not selected. Select **[Import]**.

Once the import process is done, **RPG Power Forge** may ask you to restart Unity. Select **[Install]**.
