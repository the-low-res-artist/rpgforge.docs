## RPG Power Forge v0.5 progress
*June 17th 2025*

Hi ! Please enjoy this small integrated *devlog* to follow the progress on **RPG Power Forge** development.
(Everything is still in work-in-progress)

### Main Feature : **Database** üìä
The **Database** is the base all of your Game data (*no way !*).

This is where you create Characters (with names, classes, appearance, etc), Items, Statistics, and so on.

Data are arranged in tab, which makes it easy to navigate between them. Each data type is presented as a list and can be added or removed.

Here are some of the data you can manipulate in the **Database** :
* *Characters*
* *Statistics* (or *Stats*, for short).
* *States*
* *Tags*
* *Input*
* *Dialogue presets*
* *UI skins*

### Other main feature : Dialogue Box üó®Ô∏è
I think it's and important feature ! Even tho this is just another Bahavior, the **Dialogue Box** was actually very log to build. It required both a **Theater** feature (to manage UI in-game) as well as the **Database** itself, to make presets.

### Secondary Features
I'm listing here all of the smaller features and improvements we are shipping with **RPG Power Forge 0.5** :

* Snapping 2D props to pixel-per-unit.
* This "Latest News" UI.
* Unity HUB project template creation.
* Improve the skin of the Toolbar.
* Improve the Indexation of assets (Asset Picker is now faster).
* Migrate to Unity 6.
* New onboarding UI.
