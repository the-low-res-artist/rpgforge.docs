## Summary

## Recommendations
Software | Version |
--- | --- 
Unity Hub | at least **VAR_UNITY_HUB_MIN_VERSION**
Unity Editor | at least **VAR_UNITY_MIN_VERSION**

```admonish warning title="Follow the above recommendations"
RPG Power Forge is designed to run with Unity version **VAR_UNITY_MIN_VERSION** and above. This is due to Unity fixing bugs and limitations we've raised during RPG Power Forge development. Do not use an older Unity version.
```

## Install Unity Hub

```admonish summary title="Unity Hub"

```

[[Go to the Unity website]] : [unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download). This page will ask you to download the Unity Hub.
