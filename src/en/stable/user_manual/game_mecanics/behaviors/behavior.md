The Behavior feature window is splitted in 2 panels :
* left panel : list of all attached Behaviors to the current Actor.
* right panel : detail of the current selected Behavior from the left panel.

### Tier-list

The Tier-list displays all of the Actor attached Behaviors. The list is composed of one or more Tiers : a tier has a color and represents a sub-list of Behavior. Our sample screenshot contains :
 * a Tier-list composed of 4 Tiers (Red, Yellow, Green and Blue)
 * \+ and \- Tier buttons to add and remove Tiers.
