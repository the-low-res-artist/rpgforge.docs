A Behavior can run animation(s) when activated. Depending on the Actor max directions (2, 4, or 8), you'll have to fill more slots. In the example below, the Actor has 4 directions (see Actor's [Properties](./../../../../data_management/properties.md) for more).

[[Select an Animation's checkbox]], then [[select the Edit Animations button]] and simply drag'n'drop the clips from one Collection you want.
