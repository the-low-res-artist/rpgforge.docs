## Tile Height Setter Window

The **Tile Height Setter** window has few sections :
* A "toggle visibility" button
* A set of tool to apply height to tiles easily
* A tilemap selector (same as the **Tile Palette**)
* A height selection, from 0 (lower) to 9 (higher)

## Apply the height of tiles automatically

*In developpement*

## How to go above and below ?

To change height of your playable character during play, you need to tell **RPG Power Forge** where the stairs are. This is where the **Stair prefab** comes in !

In the **[Asset Picker](./place_props.md)**, select the **Stair** prefab (under Built-In/LD). In our example, we are using the **TopDownStair** prefab.
