# Collision

This section covers collision ! Collision can be either :
* Assign to tiles / autotiles.
* Created from custom shapes in the **Asset Picker** window.

## Assign collisions to autotiles

If you already have placed tiles and props, your map could look like this.

![sample_no_collision.png](./../media/collision/sample_no_collision.PNG)

It needs collisions, overwise your character will move freely ! To do so, you can edit your tiles, located in *Assets/Project/Tiles*. Let's edit the default autotile **Tile Collection** by double-clicking it.

![collision_tile_collection_location.png](./../media/collision/collision_tile_collection_location.png)

The **Tile Collection** edit window appears. Just select the "Wood Fence" autotile and click the [Generate Collisions] ‚òëÔ∏è. Then, for this kind of autotile, choose *INNER* as the [Collision Type].

![edit_tile_collision.png](./../media/collision/edit_tile_collision.PNG)

Collision Type|Function|
--------|--------
FULL|All of the tiles have collision
INNER|Only the inner part of the tiles (for fences).
OUTER|Only the outer part of the tiles.

> üê≤ Previews on the left side should help you set the collision as you want !

Once ready, select [Apply].

All of the fences autotiles now have collision applied. Congratulations !

## Assign collisions to tiles

Like autotiles, you can assign collision to single tiles you have imported. Let's take a look at our tileset we have imported in a previous section. Double-click on the **Tile Collection** named *tileset*.

![import_tile_collection_location.png](./../media/import/import_tile_collection_location.png)

The **Tile Collection** edit window appears. Just select the "cut tree" tile and click the [Generate Collisions] ‚òëÔ∏è. Then, for this kind of tile, choose *FULL* as the [Collision Type].

![edit_tile_2_collision.png](./../media/collision/edit_tile_2_collision.PNG)

Once ready, select [Apply]. Now everytime you will draw this tile on a layer, the collision will be applied.

## Asset Picker Window

If needed , you can add custom collision shapes on your map. Just open the **Asset Picker** window.

![asset_picker_window_location.png](./../media/place_props/asset_picker_window_location.png)

Select the [Colliders] category and choose a shape.

![colliders_location.png](./../media/collision/colliders_location.PNG)

Collider shape|Function|
--------|--------
Box|Rectangle shape
Circle|Circle shape
Edge|Line shape. You add and remove points on it
Polygon|Custom polygon shape

![colliders_shapes.png](./../media/collision/colliders_shapes.PNG)

> üê≤ Once placed on a map, colliders shapes can be edited and moved by directly clicking them ! Don't forget to select the **Move tool** from the tools bar.

![colliders_edit.png](./../media/collision/colliders_edit.png)
